# jq-irl

This is the text version of my [LISA mini-tutorial] on glueing together
web-api's with bash, curl, and JQ.

[Section 0](/0-basics/index.md) Covers some curl intracieces and introduces JQ

[Section 1](/1-explore/index.md) Begins our crash-course in JQ by exploring some output from the aws cli

[Section 2](/2-select/index.md) Shows you how to select-out and filter json objects to get just want you need

[Section 3](/3-map/index.md) Shows you how to map and re-form existing json structures into new ones

[Section 4](/4-build/index.md) Comes full circle, using JQ, curl, and bash to glue together some
third party API's and make some interesting tools.
